                            <p>Get started with a new lesson with coding. It is something new to learn because the past was only knowledge of graphic designs. Therefore, let's start to learn something new in order to build on the knowledge. This is the beginning of being Web Dev.</p>

                        <p>It's a new story. This is really self-learning. But now I have no idea how to educate myself. No matter what, I still have to try my best.</p>

                            <p>I can't catch up on the content of the lesson. I will have to try more until I remember the commands. I am not good at remembering letters or commands. You have to play with it a lot until you get used to it.</p></article>

                            <p>I just moved to the city for a while. I took a walk around the city, and I realized that the atmosphere was calm, unlike the ideal city. It is fascinating even at night. Hopefully, learning in this path will enable me to find an IT job in the near future. I want to work and live in this city.</p></article>

                            <p>Sometimes my brain is unable to perceive additional material because it is too stressful. My leisure time is to take a walk outside and take pictures, such as the city, the view, and the people. It makes me feel relaxed. Walking around with my camera is great.</p></article>
